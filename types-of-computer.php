        <h3>TYPES OF COMPUTERS</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Analog computer</h4><p> These systems were the first type to be produced. It is an electronic machine capable of performing arithmetic functions on numbers which are represented by some physical quantities such as temperature,
        pressure, voltage, etc. Analog refers to circuits or numerical values that have a continuous range. Popular analog computer used in the 20th century was the slide rule.</p>
        <h4>2. Digital Computers</h4>
        <p>Virtually all modern computers are digital. Digital refers to the processes in computers that manipulate binary numbers (0s or 1s), which represent switches that are turned on or off by electrical current. A bit can have the value 0 or the value 1, but nothing in between 0 and 1. A desk lamp can serve as an example of the  difference between analog and digital. If the lamp has a simple on/off switch, then the lamp system is digital,because the lamp either produces light at a given moment or it does not. If a dimmer replaces the on/off switch, then the lamp is digital, because the amount of light can vary continuously from on to off and all intensities in
        between. Digital computers are more common in use and it will be our focus of discussion.</p>
        <h4>3. Hybrid Computer</h4>
        <p>This is when a computer make is of both analog and digital components and techniques. Such computer require analog to digital and digital to analog converter which will make analog and digital data palatable to it.
        <p>The basic classification nowadays uses the following.</p>

        <h4>4. The Mainframe</h4>
        <p>A mainframe is a computer, usually physically big, that does almost all the jobs for other types of computers that are connected to it. This is a broad definition but other aspects are involved. Like a server, the program (operating system) that runs in the mainframe defines its role.</p>
