        <h4>Input / Output Devices:</h4> 
        <p><b>Input / Output Devices (I/O)</b>- are used to enter information and instructions into a computer for storage or processing and to deliver the processed data to a user. Input/Output devices are required for users to communicate with the computer. In simple terms,
        input devices bring information INTO the computer and output devices bring information OUT of a computer system. These input/output devices are also known as peripherals since they surround the CPU and memory of a computer system.</p>
        
        <h4>Input Devices</h4>  
        <p>An input device is any device that provides input to a computer. There are many input devices, but the two most common ones are a keyboard and mouse. Every
        key you press on the keyboard and every movement or click you make with the mouse sends a specific input signal to the computer.</p>
