        <h3>What is Computer ? </h3>
            <p>A computer is a programmable machine designed to perform
            arithmetic and logical operations automatically and
            sequentially on the input given by the user and gives the desired output after processing.</p>
            <p> Computer components are divided into two major categories namely hardware and
            software. Hardware is the machine itself and its connected devices such as monitor, keyboard, mouse etc. Software are
            the set of programs that make use of hardware for performing various functions.</p>
        <p>Computer as a revolution left no area of life untouched in the present world. It is of tremendous help in all field of life. Hence, the knowledge of computer is a necessity for existence of everybody in this global
            village. The invention of computer has transformed our simple manual works to sophisticated life of automated
            works to meet the global demand for the higher productivity and increased efficiency with high precision. 
        <p>Computer is increasingly becoming compulsory in nearly all fields of studies, not because of anything but its accuracy and versatility in processing data. Many tasks at home or office are being automated rapidly
            with computer. Thus it is becoming apparent that in whatever discipline or working sector, the computer is now a very vital tool for efficiency improvement and precision of job or task execution.</p>
        <h3>Characteristics of Computers</h3>
        <p>The characteristics of computers that have made them so powerful and universally useful are speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility and storage capacity. Let us discuss them briefly.</p>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>Computers work at an incredible speed. A powerful computer is capable of performing about 3-4 million simple instructions per second.</p>
        <h3>Accuracy</h3>
        <p>In addition to being fast, computers are also accurate. Errors that may occur can almost always be attributed to human error (inaccurate data, poorly designed system or faulty instructions/programs written by the programmer).</p>
        <h3>Diligence</h3>
        <p>Unlike human beings, computers are highly consistent. They do not suffer from human traits of boredom and tiredness resulting in lack of concentration. Computers, therefore, are better than human beings in 
            performing voluminous and repetitive jobs.</p>
        <h3>Versatility</h3>
    <p>Computers are versatile machines and are capable of performing any task as long as it can be broken down into a series of logical steps. The presence of computers can be
        seen in almost every sphere – Railway/Air reservation, Banks, Hotels, Weather forecasting and many more.</p>
    <h3>Storage Capacity</h3>
    <p>Today’s computers can store large volumes of data. A piece of information once recorded (or stored) in the computer, 
        can never be forgotten and can be retrieved almost instantaneously.<p>
