        <h3>GENERATIONS OF COMPUTERS </h3>
        
        <p>The history of computer development is often referred to in reference to the different generations of computing devices. Each generation of computer is characterized by a major technological development that
        fundamentally changed the way computers operate, resulting in increasingly smaller, cheaper, more powerful, efficient and reliable devices.</p>
        <h3>First Generation - 1940-1956: Vacuum Tubes</h3>
        <p>The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often enormous, taking up entire rooms. They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of
        electricity, generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions. First generation computers relied on machine language to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time. Input was based
        on punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts. The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client. It was used in the 1951U.S. Bureau Census.</p>
        <h3>Second Generation - 1956-1963: Transistors</h3>
        <p>Transistors replaced vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. The transistor was invented in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers until the late 50s. The transistor was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energyefficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors. Second-generation computers still relied on
        punched cards for input and printouts for output. Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic, or assembly, languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words. High-level programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of COBOL and FORTRAN. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory,
        which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology. The first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry.</p>
        <h3>Third Generation - 1964-1971: Integrated Circuits</h3>
        <p>The development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of computers. Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which drastically increased
        the speed and efficiency of computers. Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with thirdgeneration computers through keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system, which allowed
        the device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory. Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were smaller and cheaper than their predecessors.<p>
        <h3>Fourth Generation - 1971-Present:Microprocessors</h3>
        <p>The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the
        hand. In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh. Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as
        more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors. As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the Internet. Fourth generation computers also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.
        </p> 
        <h3>Fifth Generation - Present and Beyond: Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Fifth generation computing devices, based on artificial intelligence, are still in development, though there are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. The use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality. Quantum computation and molecular
        and nanotechnology will radically change the face of computers in years to come. The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and selforganization.</p>
